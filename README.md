# Coworking Analytics Application

## Dockerization

To containerize the coworking analytics application, we utilize Docker. A Dockerfile is crafted to encapsulate the application's dependencies and configuration. This ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.

## Continuous Integration with CodeBuild

Continuous Integration (CI) is facilitated through AWS CodeBuild. A buildspec.yaml file is employed to define the build process. This includes setting up Docker login, building the application, tagging the image, and pushing it to Amazon ECR. This CI process ensures that new code changes are automatically built and tested, promoting rapid iteration and maintaining code quality.

## Deployment

Deployment of the Dockerized application is orchestrated using Kubernetes. Prior to deployment, ConfigMap and Secret resources are created to manage environment variables securely. These resources abstract sensitive configuration details from the application codebase. A deployment YAML file is then used to define the desired state of the application, including the Docker image version and resource requirements. Kubernetes automatically manages the deployment, scaling, and availability of the application.

## Verification

After deployment, verification of the application's functionality is crucial. This involves executing CURL commands against the application's endpoints to ensure that it behaves as expected. Additionally, monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can be leveraged to monitor the application's performance and health post-deployment. This comprehensive verification process ensures that new builds are thoroughly tested and meet the required quality standards before being released to production.
